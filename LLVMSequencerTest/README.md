# LLVMSequencerTest Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool, and is meant as a demo of the LLVMSequencer component.

## Building and Running the LLVMSequencerTest Application

In order to build the LLVMSequencerTest application, or any other F´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd LLVMSequencerTest
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the LLVMSequencerTest application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd LLVMSequencerTest
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the LLVMSequencerTest app:
```
cd LLVMSequencerTest
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd LLVMSequencerTest/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./LLVMSequencerTest -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
